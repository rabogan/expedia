# Expedia
An implementation of the back-end of expedia.com using C++

Functional Requirements:
* In this project, we implement a simple clone of expedia.com
* As you may know, in Expedia, a user has several itineraries; where each itinerary consists of:
  * 0 or more flights, hotels, or modes of transportation (e.g. 4 flights, 2 hotels and 2 cars)

An itinerary item (e.g. a flight) has:
* Its own cost
* Its info: e.g. A flight has a request from the user, and his selected flight details
* e.g. Hotel cost: total nights x price per night
* The itinerary cost is the sum of the cost of all internal items

2 types of users are included: Admin & Customer.  
The focus of the code is strictly on the Customer part at the time of typing (Nov 2022)
